## Architectural Characteristics

1. **Feasibility**

   - Budget Constraints: Startups often have limited funds, which means that every technology or solution they decide to adopt should be financially viable. This includes considerations around licensing costs, infrastructure costs, and any other operational expenses. Feasibility ensures that the proposed solution doesn't overshoot the budget.
   - Manpower and Skillset: A startup may have a small engineering team, possibly with a limited set of skills. Thus, the technology stack and solutions chosen should be within the competency of the available team, or at least easy for them to pick up. Choosing a very niche or complex tech stack may not be feasible for a small team.
   - Time-to-Market: One of the biggest advantages startups can have is the speed at which they release their products to capture the market. A feasible architecture would consider the speed of development and deployment, ensuring that the startup can launch promptly.

2. **Availability**

   - The system must always be accessible to the users; the specification states a maximum of 5 minutes per month of unplanned downtime. This means that the system must be highly available.
   - Unavailability would lead to poor user experience, especially if a traveler is relying on the application for real-time travel updates, which could in turn harm the reputation of the startup.
   - The system interfaces with external systems (airlines, hotels, car rentals). It needs to be reliable in these interactions and should have effective error-handling mechanisms to ensure users get accurate data.
   - Travelers are relying on this system for accurate and timely information, so it must be trustworthy.

3. **Performance, Responsiveness & Interoperability**

   - Travel updates must be available within 5 minutes of an update from the source. This requires a high-performance backend system that can handle the processing and pushing of these updates quickly.
   - The web application has a response time requirement of 800ms and the mobile application has a first-contentful paint time of under 1.4 seconds. Both these metrics necessitate a performant frontend and backend to meet the requirements.
   - The system needs to integrate seamlessly with various existing travel systems and should work internationally. This requires the system to be interoperable, meaning it should be capable of exchanging and making use of information from different systems without any hitches.

4. **Scalability**

   - The system needs to cater to 2 million active users per week and has a total user base of 15 million. The system needs to be scalable to handle this user base and also potential growth.
   - Being a startup, if the application becomes popular, the user base may increase rapidly. Therefore, the system should be designed to scale horizontally to cater to increased loads.

5. **Security**

   - Users are entrusting the application with their travel details, which is sensitive information. The system must ensure data protection and confidentiality.
   - The application polls and filters emails, which is a sensitive operation and requires strict security measures to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.
   - Sharing trips on social media or with specific people requires robust security mechanisms to ensure only authorized individuals can view the data.

6. **Maintainability & Testability**

   - The system integrates with multiple third-party systems (e.g., SABRE, APOLLO). As these systems evolve, the application should be architected in a way that allows for easy updates and integrations.
   - Given the dynamic nature of the travel industry, the startup may need to introduce new features or make changes frequently. A maintainable architecture ensures that these changes can be made with minimal disruption.
   - Given the variety of functionalities and integrations, it's essential that the system can be easily tested to ensure all parts work as expected.
   - Effective testing reduces the risk of bugs or issues in the live environment, which is critical given the real-time nature of the application.
   - Given the diverse set of features and third-party integrations, designing the system with modularity in mind would be beneficial. This allows different parts of the system to be developed, updated and maintained independently.

7. **Usability**
   - The application aims to provide the richest user interface possible across all platforms. This emphasizes the usability aspect, ensuring that users can easily navigate and use the system without friction.
   - Usability also relates to how easily users can manually update reservations, group items by trips, and share their trips.

## Narrative

### Identifying the underlying architectural needs via Event Storming

We decided to discover the problem space, interactions, dependencies, and flows in a Event Storming session.
The assumption is that defining the users can perform while interacting with the system,
and the work the system needs to execute to achieve expected results will allow us to identify subdomains and
interactions between them. This will allow us to define scopes & boundaries to decide which areas will drive
architectural decisions.

![eventstorming.jpeg](eventstorming%2Feventstorming.jpeg)

We identified domains:

- **Reservation** - which is responsible for managing reservations and grouping them into trips. Reservations will be constantly updated from Adapters, therefore an Event Sourced representation will be beneficial as it is more natural to the actual usage.

- **Adapters** - intended for integration with travel agencies and abstract the specifics of each and report updates to the Reservation domain as normalized update events.

- **Analytical Warehouse** - a separate component that will be collecting data from Reservations, updates, and shared content for analytical purposes so it is separated and can evolve independently from the rest of architecture as it is driven by a separate set of requirements.

- **Notifications** - a relatively simple component acting as an integration gateway with a chosen third-party provider, its implementation and size heavily depends on which will be chosen.

### Modeling the architecture [ADR01]

We envision an architecture that will provide a strong basis for the product to begin with, and be able to evolve in any direction with the changes to the product. No concrete architectural style is enforced, instead, a mix between them is picked.

Part of the systems, containing the core functionality is defined as a modular monolith, to ease the discovery and modeling process.
While the supporting functionality, external integration points are as microservices to enforce separation from the domain and allow for easier independent scaling, and error handling without affecting the main platform.

We started with modeling the architecture by skipping the first level of the C4 models - context and focusing on the containers and components.

#### Containers

![C4L2_container.png](c4%2FC4L2_container.png)

The key container is the Reservation, which owns the domain of managing reservations and trips, which is the core domain. It is also one of the two user-facing containers - thus, it also needs to contain the web server.
The actual tooling for the web server can be picked independently of the rest of the architecture as in our opinion the greatest driver is the familiarity of the platform.
The other user-facing is the Analytical Warehouse, which receives tracking and other analytical data from the client applications.

#### Components

##### Access Control Layer

![C4L3_component_acl.png](c4%2FC4L3_component_acl.png)

The Access Control Layer (ACL) diagram represents the component that manages access to the system for users who want to interact with it.
There is a second ACL, that is intended only for controlling and tracking access to shared content.

The idea is to have a clear and strong separation between data that is dedicated to the customers and freely accessible by people that were shared with.

##### Adapters [ADR02]

![C4L3_component_adapter.png](c4%2FC4L3_component_adapter.png)

The diagram visualizes three versions of adapters that will update reservations by tracking different sources of information.
The main goal of the adapters is to serve as an abstraction layer between external sources that differ in quality, availability, etc., and provide updates to the reservations.

The _E-Mail Gateway Adapter_ is intended to receive e-mails from customers, where they can forward relevant updates without integrating directly.

The _E-Mail Scanning Adapter_ scans and configures e-mail accounts for messages according to defined filters, and converts them into updates.

The _Api Travel Agency Adapter_ is designed for polling information from Travel Agencies APIs.

##### Reservations [ADR03] [ADR05]

![C4L3_component_reservation.png](c4%2FC4L3_component_reservation.png)

This is the core system. It starts as a modular monolith as this will provide the ease of evolution and extensibility needed in the early stages needed in startups. At the same time, it will allow for future extraction of subdomains if they become large enough to be independent services.

The Reservation and Trips component is the one containing all the business logic around managing reservations and grouping them into trips.

The reservations aggregate is event-sourced, and all updates from adapters are additive, this will allow for presenting changes to customers and will allow for a clear separation between the write and read model.

Trips serve as grouping containers for reservations, therefore tracking changes in the same way as for reservations will not bring significant value - Trips follow traditional columnar persistence.

Both reservations and trips are projected into a read model (Projections), which is responsible for accessing ongoing reservations and trips but also serves as an archive.
Archiving is based on copying the latest projection as a form of a snapshot of reservation and trip into separate storage (initially a separate table, but can evolve into cold storage later) and removing the event source representation from the write model.

Projections are also used for annual reporting by the Report Generator which is a periodic task running in the background.

If the customer decides to share a trip with the world, a copy of it is made into shared content storage (also a separate table, but can evolve into more specialized storage), which is the only place accessible by anonymous users.

On every update of the reservation, a notification trigger is sent to the Notification component, which will convert it into a notification message fitting a specific communication channel.

##### Analytical warehouse [ADR04] [ADR06]

![C4L3_component_warehouse.png](c4%2FC4L3_component_warehouse.png)

It is a purely passive system that receives data from the core domain - reservations, or from the client applications. Processes them before storing them in the columnar storage.
The processing is limited to ensuring anonymity of the users (PII compliance), while still keeping them relevant for analytical usage.

### Rich client [ADR07]

By choosing a framework cross-platform, we expect to save time and resources to focus on creating better interactions and features, consistent across devices.

### Evaluation, Risk assessment

The presented architecture is intended as a _starting point_ for something bigger. The main drivers were simplicity, fast development, and the ability to go to market quickly under a limited budget.

This leads to compromises, where the architecture is relatively simple, easy to set up, and understood by a small engineering team, while still able to deliver on expected characteristics.

The design is not intended to cover all possible cases that may arise, but to give a strong basis for evolution and adaptation to future product directions and popularity rise.

The main risk is that, if evolution is not disciplined, it may go in the direction where all systems are interconnected, boundaries are broken and domains are blurry.
In such cases, it will consume additional resources, and require extra effort in development - thus slowing down.

Also, the engineering team needs to keep an eye, on the moment when the system needs to evolve - e.g. the core domain of reservations and trips is split into separate more dedicated services - or they will end up in a situation where the system is barely able to handle the expected traffic.
